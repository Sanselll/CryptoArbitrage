# RL Model Refactoring Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Goal:** Fix poor RL model performance (Win Rate: 10%, Avg P&L: -0.65%)
**Target:** Win Rate >30%, Avg P&L >0.5%

---

## Problem Analysis

The RL model had access to good data but made consistently unprofitable decisions. Root causes identified:

### 1. **Reward Function Issues** ❌
- **Hold bonus dominated**: +0.212 per step × 72 steps = +15.26 reward for doing nothing
- **Trading was punished**: Entry fees scaled at 0.1× + quality penalties = -0.3 to -0.5 immediate penalty
- **P&L rewards too small**: 0.243× scaling made $100 profit = +24.3 reward (less valuable than holding)
- **Result**: Optimal policy was "hold everything and never trade"

### 2. **Feature Scaling Chaos** ❌
- Inconsistent manual scaling across features:
  - `long_funding_rate × 1000` → range 0.1 to 10
  - `fund_apr / 10` → range -5.6 to +15.3
  - `spread_volatility_stddev × 10` → range 0 to 70
- No standardization/normalization
- **Result**: Neural network couldn't learn stable patterns

### 3. **Observation/Action Space Mismatch** ❌
- Training: `max_positions=10`
- Environment default: `max_positions=3`
- Observation space sized for 3 positions
- **Result**: Agent couldn't "see" 7 of its 10 positions

### 4. **Insufficient Exploration** ❌
- Entropy coefficients too low: 0.0139 → 0.001
- With 91% bad opportunities and 9% good ones, agent needed MORE exploration
- **Result**: Premature convergence to suboptimal policy

### 5. **Gamma Too High** ❌
- Gamma = 0.9907 for 72-step episodes
- Rewards 72 steps away weighted at 0.9907^72 = 0.51 (valued equally to immediate rewards)
- **Result**: Agent didn't prioritize short-term profitable trades

## Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. **Reward Function Overhaul** (`environment.py`)

#### Removed Hold Bias:
```python
# BEFORE:
if action == 0:  # Hold
    reward += 0.212  # +15.26 per episode

# AFTER:
if action == 0:  # Hold
    return 0.0  # No bonus - neutral action
```

#### Increased P&L Reward Scale:
```python
# BEFORE:
pnl_reward_scale: float = 0.243

# AFTER:
pnl_reward_scale: float = 3.0  # 12× increase for absolute P&L optimization
```

#### Reduced Entry Fee Penalty:
```python
# BEFORE:
entry_cost = -position.entry_fees_paid_usd * 0.1  # ~-$0.066

# AFTER:
entry_cost = -position.entry_fees_paid_usd * 0.01  # ~-$0.0066 (10× less punishing)
```

#### Relaxed Quality Thresholds:
```python
# BEFORE:
if apr > 300 and spread_pct < 0.3:  # Too strict, rare
    quality_reward += bonus

# AFTER:
if apr > 150 and spread_pct < 0.4:  # Catches more profitable opportunities
    quality_reward += bonus

elif apr < 75 or spread_pct > 0.5:  # Tighter penalty threshold
    quality_reward += penalty
```

#### Added Profitable Exit Bonus:
```python
# NEW:
if pnl_pct > 0.5:  # Closing position with >0.5% gain
    realized_pnl += 1.0  # Flat bonus for good exits
```

#### Added Stop-Loss Penalty:
```python
# NEW:
if position.unrealized_pnl_pct < -1.5:  # Hit stop-loss
    total_reward += -1.0  # Penalty to discourage bad entries
```

#### Added Invalid Action Penalty:
```python
# NEW:
if invalid_action:  # Try to enter/exit non-existent position
    reward = -0.5  # Penalty to learn action space faster
```

### 2. **Feature Normalization** (`environment.py`, `fit_feature_scaler.py`)

#### Created Feature Scaler Script:
```python
# fit_feature_scaler.py
# Extracts 22 raw features, fits StandardScaler, saves to disk
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X)  # X shape: (154,787 opportunities, 22 features)
pickle.dump(scaler, open('models/rl/feature_scaler.pkl', 'wb'))
```

#### Updated Feature Extraction (RAW features, no manual scaling):
```python
# BEFORE (chaotic):
opp.get('long_funding_rate', 0) * 1000,
opp.get('fund_apr', 0) / 10,
opp.get('spread_volatility_stddev', 0) * 10,

# AFTER (raw):
opp.get('long_funding_rate', 0),  # RAW
opp.get('fund_apr', 0),  # RAW
opp.get('spread_volatility_stddev', 0),  # RAW
```

#### Applied StandardScaler in Observation:
```python
# NEW:
if self.feature_scaler is not None:
    opp_reshaped = opportunity_features.reshape(5, 22)
    opp_scaled = self.feature_scaler.transform(opp_reshaped)  # Mean=0, Std=1
    opportunity_features = opp_scaled.flatten()
```

### 3. **Fixed max_positions Mismatch** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# BEFORE:
max_positions=10  # Training config
# But environment default was 3

# AFTER:
max_positions=3  # Consistent everywhere
```

### 4. **Increased Exploration** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# BEFORE:
ent_coef_initial: float = 0.0139
ent_coef_final: float = 0.0010

# AFTER:
ent_coef_initial: float = 0.08  # 6× increase
ent_coef_final: float = 0.02    # 20× increase (maintain exploration)
```

### 5. **Adjusted Gamma** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# BEFORE:
gamma: float = 0.9907  # Too high for 72-step episodes

# AFTER:
gamma: float = 0.96  # Better discounting for 72-step horizon
```

### 6. **Added Network Normalization** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# NEW:
policy_kwargs = dict(
    net_arch=dict(pi=[256, 256], vf=[256, 256]),
    activation_fn=torch.nn.ReLU,
    normalize_features=True  # Running mean/std normalization
)
```

### 7. **Increased Training Timesteps** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# BEFORE:
total_timesteps: int = 500000

# AFTER:
total_timesteps: int = 1000000  # 2× increase for learning from noisy data
```

### 8. **Updated Default Paths** (`train_rl_agent.py`)

```python
# BEFORE:
data_path: str = 'data/rl_train.csv'

# AFTER:
data_path: str = 'data/rl_training_opportunities.csv'
feature_scaler_path: str = 'models/rl/feature_scaler.pkl'
```

## Expected Impact 🎯

### **Critical Fixes** (Est. +200-300% improvement):
1. **Reward function fix**: Removes hold bias, makes trading rewarding
   - Before: +15.26 reward for holding entire episode
   - After: 0.0 reward for holding, +300+ reward for 1% profit on $10k
   - **Impact**: Agent now incentivized to find profitable trades

2. **Feature normalization**: Neural network can learn stable patterns
   - Before: Features ranged from 0.001 to 1000 (chaotic)
   - After: All features normalized to mean=0, std=1 (stable)
   - **Impact**: Network learns 3-5× faster, more robust

### **High Priority Fixes** (Est. +50-100% improvement):
3. **Increased exploration**: Finds the 9% profitable opportunities in noise
4. **Lower gamma**: Prioritizes near-term profits over distant rewards
5. **Fixed observation space**: Agent sees all positions correctly

### **Combined Expected Results**:
- **Win Rate**: 10% → 30-40%
- **Avg P&L**: -0.65% → +0.5% to +1.5%
- **Avg Reward**: -11.97 → +20 to +50
- **Agent Behavior**: Will actively trade profitable opportunities instead of holding

## Verification Checklist

After training the new model, verify:

- [ ] Feature scaler exists: `models/rl/feature_scaler.pkl`
- [ ] Environment loads scaler and shows: `✅ Feature scaler loaded`
- [ ] Observation space: 133 dimensions (14 portfolio + 5×22 opportunities + 5 padding)
- [ ] Action space: 9 actions (1 hold + 5 enter + 3 exit)
- [ ] Agent takes ENTRY actions (not just holding)
- [ ] Win rate > 30%
- [ ] Average P&L > 0.5%
- [ ] No NaN/inf in observations or rewards

---

## Debugging Tips

If model still performs poorly:

1. **Check scaler is loaded**:
   ```
   Environment logs should show: "Feature scaler loaded from: models/rl/feature_scaler.pkl"
   ```

2. **Verify features are normalized**:
   - Add logging in `environment.py:658` to print `observation.mean()` and `observation.std()`
   - Opportunity features should have ~mean=0, ~std=1

3. **Monitor training logs**:
   - Tensorboard: `tensorboard --logdir models/rl/ppo_TIMESTAMP/tensorboard`
   - Look for: `train/ent_coef` decreasing from 0.08 to 0.02
   - Look for: `rollout/ep_rew_mean` increasing over time
   - Look for: Actions diversifying (not all action 0)

4. **Check reward distribution**:
   - If all rewards ~0: P&L scaling may be too low
   - If all rewards negative: Entry penalties too high
   - If agent only holds: Hold bonus not removed properly

---

## Rollback Plan

If new model performs worse, revert to old hyperparameters:

```python
# In train_rl_agent.py:
gamma: float = 0.9907  # Old value
ent_coef_initial: float = 0.0139
ent_coef_final: float = 0.0010
pnl_reward_scale: float = 0.243
hold_bonus: float = 0.212
```

But **keep**:
- Feature normalization (critical for stability)
- max_positions=3 fix (critical for correctness)
- Invalid action penalties (helps learning)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fit feature scaler: `python fit_feature_scaler.py`
2. ⏭️ Train new model: `python train_rl_agent.py --timesteps 1000000`
3. ⏭️ Evaluate on test set
4. ⏭️ Compare to baseline (old model, random policy, simple heuristic)
5. ⏭️ If successful (>30% win rate), deploy to paper trading
6. ⏭️ Monitor real-world performance for 1-2 weeks
7. ⏭️ Iterate on reward function based on learned behaviors
